*class* is a reference to the class for this stage. Classes can be referenced in three ways:
* a path pointing to a local yaml file containing the class; this path has to start with a '/' or a '.'
* an image with a `stage-class` label containing a base64 encoded class yaml
* a class name defined in the configured classpath
