*class* specifies the class underlying this stage. Classes can be specified in three ways:
* a path pointing to a yaml file containing the class; this path has to start with a '/' or a '.'
* an image with a `stage-class` label containing a base64 encoded class file
* a class name defined in the configured classpath
