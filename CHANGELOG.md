* create
  * report an error is stage already attached (previous version created the stage *and* reported an error)
  * reject stage names with upper-case characters (thanks to Jan G)
* build: 
  * fixed origin to also check parent directories; this is needed if a project is just a module in the git or svn checkout
    (thanks to Jan G)
  * use origin "unknown" if neither git nor svn checkouts are detected
* fixed java version detection if JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS are set (thanks to Radek S)
* properly report Stool server name if it returns eof
* added `ENGINE_LOG` server configuration
* reject `REGISTRY_PREFIX` server configuration with upper cases characters


### 5.0.0 (2019-06-24)

#### Architecture

Stool 5 separates building from running stages: you build on your local workstation, but run on a server. 
To implement this, Stool was split into a client and a server part: the client runs on your local machine, and the server
runs as a daemon on the server. Both communicate via rest (and you can run them both on the same machine).
Example: to create a new stage for a project on your local workstation, run:

    cd your/project                       # enter the project directory on your local workstation
    mvn clean install                     # or whatever you need to build your project from sources
    stool create teststage@someserver     # create a new stage on the server
    stool build                           # takes the war from your workstation to build a so-called image on the server
    stool start                           # start you app on the server
    

#### Checkout and build changes
 
Stool is no longer responsible to checkout projects or build wars. Instead, it now expects existing projects with readily built wars. 

As a consequence, all features to manage projects were removed from Stool:
* dumped the distinction between source and artifact stages; Stool now simply looks for `**/target/*.war` files 
* the former `build` command to build a war for a source stage has been replaced by a new `build` command to build an image
* the former `start` command no longer builds an image - it now expects a readily built image
* the `create` command now expects an existing project
* the `remove` command now just removes the stage - the project is *not* removed
* dumped the `refresh` command
  * dumped `refresh` stage config
  * dumped `autoRefresh` stage config
* dumped `build` command and the respective configuration
  * `build`, `pom`, `maven.home`, `maven.opts`, `prepare`
  * dumped stage directory lock - Stool now assumes that the project is used exclusively by the current user
  * dumped Maven Embedded dependency
* dumped `committed` configuration - start no longer checks for local modifications
* dumped the `move` command
* dumped svn credentials handling
* dumped macros
* Stool no longer adjusts the current working directory
  * dumped `cd` 
  * dumped `select` (use `pommes goto` instead)

#### Improved Docker integration

* dumped all bind mounts except for the log file directory and the https certificates;
  (instead of the vhosts bind mount the war file is copied into the image now)
* replaced Stool config template arguments by Docker build arguments and Docker environment arguments:
  TODO: all details
    * replaced stage property `memory` by an build argument
    * replaced stage property `url` by `server` and `suffixes` build arguments
  * Stool now creates one image per war file (the previous version created one image per Stage)
  * downloading Tomcat was moved into a Tomcat base image; Tomcat download functionality was removed from Stool
  * removed Freemarker templates, a Stool template is a plain Dockerfile now
  * images now declare exposed ports via labels; when starting a stage, Stool sets up the respective mapping
  * dumped `port` command, instead, start has http and https options now
  * switch keystore format from JKS to PKCS12
  * changes in the standard Dockerfile
    * no longer set `-Xmx` (let the jvm figure out this)
    * changed server.xml: set `deployXML` to false 
      (since we now have exactly one web application per Tomcat, crossContext has no meaning; 
      and I checked controlpanel trunk - is doesn't contain any symlink, so we can live without `allowLinking`)

#### Other changes

* split the `main` module into a `client` and a `server` module, the communicate via rest; merged the dashboard into the server modules
  
* dashboard
  * dumped auto-reload of the ui
  * build and refresh are gone - use restart instead
  * is now part of the server - it's the name over the overview page
  * added link to logs
  * updated bootstrap to 4.3.1
  
* internal changes
  * dumped Debian packages: use application files from Maven Central instead; they work for Mac OS as well


* stool home layout changes
  * system directory is gone - there are no system stages any more
  * run directory is gone - ports and locks are implemented by asking docker and storing them in memory
  * downloads is gone - Stool no longer performs downloads, place them in your (base) Docker file instead
  
* replaced the `.backstage` directory tree by a single `.backstage` file; 
  what happened to former files in this directory:
  * config.json was moved to the server;
  * docker context directory and `image.log` was moved to the server (use the history command to see the image.log)
  * `container.id` is gone (instead, Stool queries the docker daemon to get running containers)  


* dumped stage id, always use the name now
* dumped the `rename` command; if you need to rename a stage, you now have to remove and re-create it now

* removed client-side locking, logging and exception emails
* removed `working` state

* added `running` field

* added `remove -stop` option
* added `attach` and `detatch` commands to manage project - stage association
* removed stageName column from server logs
* stool config changes
  * dumped `diskMin`
  * dumped `macros`
  * dumped `search`

* Debug and Jmx ports of stages now bind to localhost; use the new `tunnel` command to gain remote access
* use jmxmp
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11412560/where-to-download-jmxmp
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11413178/how-to-enable-jmxmp-in-tomcat
  
  
* dumped user defaults -- only Max had used them
* stage filter with substring, and case-insensitive

* dumped "Manager" tag from server

* validate now sends emails per stage
  
* dumped isSelected field
* dumped cleanup command: there's no m2 repository to cleanup, and log file rotation has to be part of the server configuration
* adjust help column width to terminal size
* removed `sleep` state and the corresponding `stop -sleep` flag, it was never used
* removed `shared` switch - local maven repository is now always the user's Maven repository
* removed `system` marker for stages
* quota now checks the container disk size; dumped the original disk size field and replaced it by the former container-disk field
* implementation changes
  * split Stage Class into a Project- and a new Stage class: project is everything around the former stage directory (which is 
    typically the checkout); the new Stage roughly represents the backstage directory
  * tomcatOpts no longer support macros
  * source bind mounts (used for fitnesse) are gone
  * remove Project.updatesAvailable
  
* use docker api 1.38, that's the version available on Alex' old Ubuntu setup
* dumped various 'auto' options - they were disabled for all remaining commands exception `remove`
* start now takes an image index argument
* added "app" command
* dumped `type` field
* updated inline 1.1.1 to 1.2.0
* separate Start and Build commands; as a consequence, the restart command no longer has a nocache option; `build` is a project command


### 4.0.3 (2019-02-13)

* dashboard
  * show stage comment has hover on stage name (stage origin is now show as hover on stage status)
  * sort stages by name (but all reserved stages first)
  * feedback as a popup
  * stage update fixes: properly handle renamed and removed stages 
  * removed progress bar - it was dead
  * removed breadcrumbs, they just cluttered the outout
  * implementation changes

    * updated bootstrap 3.2.0 to 4.2.1 and jquery 1.11.0 to 3.3.1
    * removed "shepherd" - it's unused
    * removed "driftwood" (https://github.com/mattkanwisher/driftwood.js) - it wasen't set up properly
    * removed "requireJS" - it's overkill
    * removed "glyphicon" font
    * updated to font awesome 5.7
  * dependency updates: 
  * slf4j-api 1.7.21 to 1.7.25

  * spring 4.1.6 to 5.1.4
  * spring security 4.0.0 to 5.1.3

  * fixed "stage ping" to reliably detect when tomcat startup is complete 
    (I now check tomcat engine status via jconsole; the previous application url ping was unreliable and cause integration test issues)
  * fixed quota check to include container disk size
  * added `container-disk` status field to indicate the size of the rw layer of the container
  * implementation changes:
    * removed "changes" code (it was unused)

  * update sushi 3.1.7 to 3.2.0


### 4.0.1 (2018-08-01)

* fixed umask in fitnesse launcher script, which causes fitnesse containers to fail when started by a different user
  (thanks to GÃ¶khan)
* fixed 'fault resolve' calls to use the stage's local repository, not the user's local repository


### 4.0.0 (2018-07-13)

Stool 4 runs stages as docker containers: if you start a stage, Stool create a Docker image based on a template and start a container for it.
Resulting changes:

* *templates* replace *extensions*
  * a stage has exactly one template assigned; switch to a different template with `stool config template=othertemplate`
  * a template is a directory with a `Dockerfile.fm` and other files. When starting the stage, Stool passes all *.fm
    files through [FreeMarker](http://freemarker.org/docs/ref_directives.html), invokes `docker build` on the resulting server
    directory, and starts a container for this image
  * in addition to FreeMarker functionality, Dockerfiles can:
    * define configuration fields with `#CONFIG <type> <name>`; use `stool config <template>.<name>=<value>` to change values
    * define status fields with `#STATUS`
  * renamed `$HOME/extensions` directory to `$HOME/templates`, which contains one directory for every available template
  * moved `pustefix` extension functionality into the `tomcat` template; thus `pustefix.mode` is now called `tomcat.mode` 
  * dumped `logstash` extension, it was never used, and we'll have filebeat instead
  * dumped `fault` extension, the tomcat template auto-detects applications that need fault
* `stool status` changes
  * `container` (with the container hash) replaces `tomcat` and `service` (with pids)
  * replaced `jmx` and `jmxHeap` by template-defined status `tomcat.ports` (which also includes the debug port) and `tomcat.heap`
  * replaced `debugger` and `suspend` by template-defined configuration `tomcat.debug` and `tomcat.suspend`
  * renamed `creator` field to `created-by` and `created` to `created-at`
  * dumped `fitnesse`; fitnesse stages are based on the new `fitnesse` template now
  * dumped `other` status field
* stage property changes
  * dumped `tomcat.env` - adjust the template instead
  * dumped `tomcat.service` - the service wrapper is gone
  * `tomcat.version` is a template configuration now; changed default value from 8.5.16 to 9.0.8
  * `tomcat.opts` is a template configuration now
  * renamed `tomcat.heap` to `memory`, changed default from 350 to 400 or 200m for every webapp;
    tomcat heap defaults set to 75% of that
  * replaced `cookies` by tomcat template code, valid values are `OFF`, `STRICT` or `LEGACY`
  * renamed `tomcat.select` to `select`
  * dumped `java.home` because Containers bring their own settings; builds use the globally installed Jdk on the machine
* Stool property cleanup
  * renamed `baseHeap` to `baseMemory`, changed default form 350 to 400
  * dumped `downloadTomcat`, this value is hard-coded into the Tomcat template now
  * removed deprecated `@owner` and `@maintainer` in contact shortcuts
  * renamed `ldapSso` to `ldapUnit`
  * removed `downloadsCache` property, use symlinks for $STOOL_HOME/downloads instead
  * dumped `downloadServiceWrapper` - the service wrapper is gone
  * dumped `certificates`, the respective code has moved into the template
  * added `systemExtras` for directories available to system applications
* dumped `system-import` command (and also the upgrade code)
* dumped redundant `stage` entries in $STOOL_HOME/ports
* cli changes
  * dumped `-debug` and `-suspend` options from `start` and `restart` (and the corresponding defaults); use the `config`
    command instead to set the respective template field
  * dumped `start -fitnesse`; create stage for Fitnesse tests with `template=fitnesse` instead
  * `start -tail` now tails container logs
  * added `start -nocache` and `restart -nocache` option to force rebuild the docker image
* `.backstage` changes
  * `service` is gone
  * renamed `maintainer` to `modified`
  * dumped 'run' subdirectory
  * dumped `tomcat` directory; logs go into `logs` instead, all other sudirectories are now part of the container
* application facing changes
  * dumped Java Service Wrapper, Tomcat is started directly inside the container; as a consequence, stages no longer allocate
    a service wrapper port and a Tomcat stop port
  * dumped -D variables `-Dstool.cp`, `-Dstool.home` and `-Dstool.idlink`, the respective paths are not available in the container
  * Tomcat template
    * disable Tomcat Http 2 Support, it never worked with the connector we use
    * install all of Tomcat in `/usr/local/tomcat`, no longer distinguish CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE
    * Stool no longer adds

          org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[Catalina].level = INFO
          org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[Catalina].handlers = 1catalina.org.apache.juli.FileHandler

      to Tomcat logging.properties

Some implementation notes:
* I did *not* use a Docker client library (e.g. docker-java) because I wanted to keep things small and I wanted to learn the
  rest api myself
* I use jnr-unixsocket to talk to docker daemons; there are more specialized libraries for that (e.g. junixsocket), but
  from what I found they need native code and/or are quiet old

Other changes:
* Tomcat downloads now check the sha1 hash of the download
* stage status `url` renamed to stage `origin` (to resolve naming clash with stage config `url`)
* Dashboard
  * removed `start -fitnesse` command
  * added `cleanup` command
  * added `expire in 1 week` command
  * fixed console output when running without svn credentials

### 3.4.11 (2018-11-23) 

* fixed race condition in `remove` command


### 3.4.10 (2017-10-05)

* renamed `fault.project` property to `fault.projects`
  Migration note: old `fault.project` settings will be ignored, and an empty value is used instead; changing an arbitrary 
  property replaces the `fault.project` with an empty `fault.projects` entry in `.backstage/config.json`
* fixed `stool cd` for stages started with fault
* dashboard: (contributed by maxbraun)
  * added time-left estimate
  * fixed browser freeze it build output becomes too long
* update to sushi 3.8.10 to work with Jdk 1.8.0_144 (thanks to Marcus T)
  * Stool itself did not build
  * `stool start` failed to created the service-wrapper.sh
  

### 3.4.9 (2017-08-01)

* added `fault` template to start stages with fault workspace
* changed default Tomcat version from 8.5.8 to 8.5.16; switched the default download location from http to https
* changed default Service Wrapper version from 3.5.30 to 3.5.32; adjusted default download location from
  http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/download/$v to https://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/download/$v?mode=download
* added `heap` status field indicating percentage of max heap actually used (for Stefan H)
* added user defaults `svn.user` and `svn.password` to define defaults for `-svnuser` and `-svnpassword` (for Stefan H)
* improved quota error message (for Andreas K)
* fixed `stool create gav:...` for multiple artifacts - refresh directory was created more once (for Radek S)
* fixed Tomcat configuration for non-empty server path - the initial slash was missing, which yields a Tomcat warning
  (thanks to Max B)
* fixed stale stage wiper to *not* remove inaccessible stages;
  the old behaviour was very confusing: if a user created a stage in his home (and maybe started it), the stage was 
  considered stale and automatically wiped (without no way to stop it) if a different user invoked Stool; 
  the new behavior issues an 'inaccessible' warning instead of removing it
* former stage fixes (a former stage is not a stage, it's just a directory with a .backstage subdirectory which is not
  references from stool/backstages):  
  * fixed stage indicate to *not* flag former stages as stages
  * fixed 'stool list' and 'stool status' if the current directory is a former stage 


### 3.4.8 (2017-01-23)

* renamed status fields:
  * `maintainer` becomes `last-modified-by`
  * `maintained` becomes `last-modified-at`
* changed default value for `notify` from `@maintainer @creator` to `@creator`
* fixed url defaults, they never worked (thanks to Max)
* ldap tweaks (thanks to Stefan H)
  * dashboard sso is now configured with the `sso` property in `$STOOL_HOME/system/dashboard.properties`
  * ldap unit (for ldap lookup and dashboard sso) is now configurable via ldap.sso 
    (ldap.sso will be renamed to ldap.unit in stool 3.5; it's not renamed now to avoid the migration efford)
* dumped `system-start` and `system-stop`, use `start -all`  and `stop -all` instead
* adjust autoconf url for cp: replaced /xml/config by (/internal-login)
* added UpgradeProtocol configuration for Tomcat 8.5 and 9


### 3.4.7 (2016-12-27)

* fixed build command locking: lock mode none erroneously created a shared lock, which caused a single build command to block any start command
  lock (many thanks to Christina for detecting this!)
* fixed NPE in `stool status` for stale tomcat.pid file (for Simon)


### 3.4.6 (2016-12-08) 

* added `start -fitnesse` and `restart -fitnesse` options to start the fitnesse wikis instead of the applications; 
  also added a `Start Fitness` action to the dashboard; running fitnesse wikis is indicated by the new status field `fitnesse`. 
* disabled the fitnesse template - setting the `fitnesse` property to true will abort `stool start` with an error
* fixed port garbage collection - unused ports are properly freed now
* `stool validate`: fixed duplicate lines in console output
* changed default `tomcat.version` from 8.5.6 to 8.5.8 (which fixes "Unable to add the resource at *somePath* to the cache" )
* changed default `service.version` from 3.5.29 to 3.5.30
* locking tweaks (for Stefan M. and Tesa): 
  * `cleanup` no longer acquires directory locks
  * `list` and `status` no acquires fetches directory locks
  * `move` acquires exclusive directory locks now
  * `remove` acquires exclusive backstage and directory locks now
* $STOOL_HOME is configurable now, default is ~/.stool
* Debian packages reworked:
  * Main package:
    * No longer contains a home directory. Instead, the default is that every user creates his own home.
    * Removed the Debian service. Because there's no longer a unique home to start stages from.
  * Dashboard package: dumped. Because there's no longer a unique home to install it to.
* Development:
  * enable service wrapper debug output if stool was invoked with `-v`
  * simplified build: no longer depends on a custom version of jdeb
  * speedup dashboard build
* improved error message if a backstage directory has no link in `backstages` (for Max).


### 3.4.5 (2016-11-21)

* CAUTION: stop all stages before updating from 3.4.x. (Because the stop mechanism has changed, 3.4.5 cannot stop stages started from older versions.)

* `stool status`: 
  * added new fields:
    * `created` indicates when a stage was created
    * `maintainer` indicates the person that last changed a stage
    * `maintained` is the timestamp of this change
  * fixed exception if service wrapper has no child process

* improved `history` command:
  * speed-up
  * print latest command first
  * simplified details handling: 
    * it's just a global `-details` switch now
    * added `history.details` defaults settings
  * properly log stacktraces, also fixed escaping
  * include create and import commands for the stage
  
* Stool user (for Philipp)
  * Stool now distinguishes the Stool user (used for logging and emails) from the OS user 
    (owner of files and processes, someone with an account on the local machine)
  * configured via environment variable `STOOL_USER`. It not defined, Stool uses the Java system property `user.name`

* chown-less operation:
  * dumped `chown` command since it's no longer needed; instead, admins now have to take care that sharing the files does not cause permission problems
  * removed -autoChown and -autoRechown options
  * removed `owner` status field; changed the dashboard to show the `maintainer` instead

* dumped all sudo rules and `$STOOL_HOME/bin` scripts
  * =chowntree.sd= (no longer needed, because chown is gone; see chown-less operation above). This fixes a critical security problem (thanks to Bernd!)
  * get service-wrapper without sudo
    * instead, it's now started as the current OS user
    * and it's stopped with via anchor file; every user with wx permissions on $backstage/run and $backstage/run/tomcat.anchor can stop a stage 
  * dashboard now invokes Stool commands without sudo, it sets the Stool user to the authenticated user (or, it not authenticated, the Stool user of the dashboard itself)

* stage indicator color is gone: red no longer makes sense, because there's no chown you have to use; and blue was already impossible since  
  the backstage directory moved into the stage directory in Stool 3.4.0

* improved `import` command: re-use backstage directory if it already exists

* improved build command (for Christina)
  * added command parameters to be executed instead of the configured `build` property 
  * added a `-here` option to execute in the current directory

* improved expire property (for Stefan)
  * you can now specify a number instead of a date; it will be translated into the specified number of days from today
  * you can specify the number in your defaults
  * build-in default is now always `never`, it no longer depends on the shared mode; use defaults to configure direfferent values

* fixed `noSuchDirectory` in catalina base, there's now an empty `webapps` directory instead (for Felix).

* bumped lock timeout from 10 to 30 seconds (for Falk).

* Debian packages
  * no longer create a group or a user - both are assumed to already exist now.
  * no longer create a cron jobs - that's up to the user now (because it easy to setup and every body has slightly different needs)


### 3.4.4 (2016-10-17)

* updated default Tomcat version from 8.5.3 to 8.5.6
* fixed bash completion for systems where `ls` is an alias
* removed support for IT-CA certificates
* logstash improvements: `logstash.output` is unused now, the launcher script (configured in `logstash.link` 
  is now expected to generate the configuration as well


### 3.4.3 (2016-09-22)

* `stool validate` now sends a notification if the certificate expires in less than 10 days.
* logstash improvements
  * one logstash process per stage
  * logstash.link now configures a bash script to actually launch the logstash process 
  * logstash.output now specifies a list of files to append for the *input* config generated by stool
* fixed `stool create` gav in shared mode (thanks to Maximilian)
* fixed `stool refresh` on artifact stages
* fixed performance problem in `stool list` (thanks to Gelli)
* fixed Dashboard candel butten - by removing it (thanks to Cosmin)


### 3.4.2 (2016-08-11)

* Dumped predefined STOOL_OPTS from /etc/profile.de/stool
* Global `certificates` property now also accepts a script file name to generate the Java keystore used by Tomcat.
* Added setup `-batch` option
* Converted documentation from docbook to markdown; merged site module into main.


### 3.4.1 (2016-08-02)

* auto options fix: restart running stages if it needs chowning and both -autorestart and -autorechown are specified
* changed default quota from 40000 to 10000
* fixed NPE in `history` command
* fixed quota computation: skip negative values
* `list` now prints the reserved quota (instead of the available space on the home partition)
* fixed `create` and the `diskMin` property to check available space on the target partion, not the partition for Stool home.
* fixed duplicate line in email notifications
* changed logging to create log files with the date appended; gzip them after a day, remove them after 90 days.
* added `creator` status field and `@creator` email alias
* stage indicator tweaks
  * prefix functions with __ to keep namespace and bash completion clean
  * fixed control sequence escaping in stage indicator
  * fixed color to always check the stage directory itself
* implementation changes:
  * speedup `stool list`
  * update Java Mail 1.5.0b1 to 1.5.5

  
### 3.4.0 (2016-07-28)

* auto select:
  * the selected stage is now determined by the current directory
  * to build a stage with the proper environment, you have to use `stool build` now. 
    Stool no longer adjust the environment for the current stage.

* certificate handling
  * generate self-signed certificate if no `certificates` url is specified
  * generate puki certificates for other urls
  
* added support for git urls. To distinguish between svn- and git urls, source stage urls are now prefixed with `svn:` or `git:`.

* system stages are now placed in $HOME/system

* per-user defauls: Stool now checks for a user's `~/.stool.defaults` file. If it exists, Stool loads it as a properties 
  file and uses it as default values for options. For example, a property `refresh.build=true` causes `stool refresh` to build a stage
  without explicitly specify `-build`. To override this default, use `stool refresh -build=false`. 
  For a list of available properties, see the "User defaults" section of the documentation.

* Added `select -fuzzy` option a stage if the specifed name is not found but there's ony one suggestion.

* Logstash template

* `status` command
  * added `cpu`, `mem`, `selected` and `buildtime` fields
  * can also access properties now (actually, name is a property)
  * fixed status field `tomcat` to contain the tomcat pid, not the service wrapper pid; added a new `service` field to contain the 
    service wrapper pid.

* `list` command has the same configurable fields and properties as the `status` command now. Defaults no longer contain the 
  selected stage; the stage directory has been added to the defaults.

* `start` command now deletes $TOMCAT/temp and creates a new empty directory

* The stage name is a property now.
  * `stool rename foo` is gone, use `stool config name=foo` instead. 
  * `stool create -name foo url` is gone, use `stool create url name=foo` instead.

* Global configuration:
  * renamed `contactAdmin` to `admin`.
  * removed `prompt`, it's no longer needed because is a plain executable now. 
  * Pommes is no longer hard-wired, there's a global `search` property to configure arbitrary search tools.

  * default base heap is 350 now
  * added `quota` to limit the disk spaced occupied by the stage.
  * added `notify` to configure email notifications.
  * dumped `sslUrl` 
  * renamed `suffixes` to `url`. Changed the syntax so you can specify protocols, prefixes, suffixes and a server
  * renamed `until` to `expire` (and the value `reserved` to `never`)
  * removed `tomcat.perm` because it's ignored by Java 8.
  * changed default tomcat version from 8.0.26 to 8.5.3
  * changed default service wrapper version from 3.5.26 to 3.5.29
  * changed default diskMin to 1000


* simplified directory structure:
  * backstage directories moved from `$LIB/backstages/stagename` to `stagedir/.backstage`.
  * dumped `$BACKSTAGE/shared`, $BACKSTAGE now directly contains all subdirectories
  * renamed `$BACKSTAGE/conf` to `$BACKSTAGE/service`

* changed system-start and system-stop to always use fail mode after
* start and stop for multiple stages is executed in parallel now.

  * arbitrary location for `stool` binary
  * $LIB is either `~/.stool` or `/usr/share/stool`
  * improved default configuration
  * atomic upgrade: creates a backup of the lib directory before upgrade; this is restored if the upgrade fails

* Fixed dns validation to use proper hostname and port.


### 3.3.4 (2016-03-15)

* Merged system-validate into the validate command.
* Improved validate: send an email if your stage was removed; send on email per user, even for multiple broken stages; a single
  `-repair` option replaces the previous `-stop` and `-repair-locks` options; check that the configured hostname is this machine.
* Fixed stop problem when a stage is in debug mode: set timeout to 1h (instead of infinite).
* Changed initial java.home to optionally remove the tailing /jre. This fixes a problem on Mac OS when invoking Java command line tools like jar.
* Print an error message the user tries to start pustfix editor (to prepare to dump it)

* stool create: Fixed "Artifact x:y:z not found" error message to include the underlying Maven problem (in particular "Unauthorized").
* Fixed missing date in history command.
* Fixed lost exception when probing svn checkouts.


### 3.3.1 (2015-12-21)

* Fixed missing stool function in non-login shells.
* Fixed missing vhosts in global config.json.
* Fixed run/users/root with empty prompt - 'service stool &lt;cmd>' no longer creates this file.
* Fixed group permissions for backstage/shared/ssl/tomcat.p12.
* Fixed NPE for predicate with unknown property or field; issue proper error message instead.
* Fixed exception emails.
* 'stool start' now reports an error if the hostname name cannot be resolved. And pinging the application has a 5 minutes timeout now.
* Changed the port command to separate application and port by '=' (indead of ':').
* Fixed Stool 3.2.x upgrade code to properly migrate ports of workspaces, special ports, and suffixes in global defaults.
* Generalized suffixes: if a suffix contains [], the resulting application url is the suffix with [] substituted by hostname:port.
* Fixed duplicate -autorechown/-autorestart options in dashboard refresh.
* Moved stage property description from the config command to the documentation (man stool-config).


### 3.3.0 (2015-11-30)

* Renamed overview to dashboard.
* Added '-autostop', '-autorestart', '-autochown' and '-autorechown' options for all stage commands.
* 'stool refresh': Removed implicit re-chowning and re-starting. If you need this functionality, get 'refresh' with the new auto
  options for stage commands: use 'stool refresh -autorechown -autorestart' to get the old behavior.
* 'stool remove': Removed implicit stopping. If you need this functionality, get 'stool remove -autostop'.
* Adjusted the 'chown' command for the new '-autorestart' options: 'chown' now reports an error, if the stage is up.
  Use  '-autorestart' to get the old behavior. The old '-stop' option is gone.
* Removed the 'build -restart' option, use '-autorestart' instead.
* Updated default tomcat version from 7.0.57 to 8.0.26.
* Fixed permission problem on Fitnesse log files; all output is written to backstage/shared/tomcat/logs/fitnesse.log now.
* Retry ldap query if an CommunicationException occured.
* Fitnesse template: Fixed NPE during stage stop when fitnesse is enabled while tomcat is running.
* Fixed tomcat.perm configuration.
* @proxyOpts@ is a normal macro now, and it is no longer computed from the stage owner's environment. If you need proxy configuration,
  you defined it in the global configuration and adjust your stage defaults to use it for all stages.
* Removed Stool update-checks, the packaging system is responsible for this now.
* 'stool config' now supports a "{}" place holder to refer to the previous value. You can use this e.g. to append to a property:
  'stool config "tomcat.opts={} -Dfoo=bar".
* Fixed exception if history argument is not a number. Issue proper error message now.
* You can create artifact stages from either gav: or file: urls now. Example: 'stool create file:///path/to/my.war'.
  You can specify multiple comma-separates urls (instead of the previous multiple coordinates within one gav url).
* Improved setup: Debian package is configurable with debconf now, and it's separated into a stool and a stool-dashboard package now.
* Changed the 'suffix' stage property to 'suffixes', it holds a list now.
* Improved locking (i.e. less waiting for lock messages): replace the old global- and stage-semaphores by one global read/write lock,
  and per-stage a backstage read/write lock and a directory read/write lock.
* 'stool restart': remove 5 seconds sleep.
* Simplified cwd handling: only the following commands change the current directory: create, remove, select and cd.
* Removed allowLinking in server.xml. Because it's no longer needed for Controlpanel and the configuration differs between
  Tomcat 7 and Tomcat 8.
* Fixed wrong capitalization in server.xml for element host alias
* Merged all {stage}/ports files into one {home}/run/ports file.
* Support stages with empty MAVEN_HOME: Stool includes ${home}/maven-settings.xml now, they are used to resolve dependencies if
  the current user has no MAVEN_HOME.
* The separator for list property values is "," now, space is no longer supported.
* 'stool config': Display properties as strings, not as json objects.
* The 'tomcat.env' property is a map now, it defines the environment for applications.
  (Because the old white-listing is hard to debug and problematic when starting an application as a different user.)
* Removed the global 'errorTool' property, report problems to configured 'adminEmail' instead.
* 'stool select': Fixed illegal argument exception if the use specified an absolute path instead of stage name.
* Removed global 'portOverview' property.


### 3.2.0 (2015-08-09)

* Fix persistent ldap connection problem in overview.
* Renamed user "servlet" to "stool".
* Changed permission for stool files from 666 to 664.
* Properly set setgid bit for home directory and every stage directory.
*  Moved $STOOL_HOME/conf/overview.properties to $STOOL_HOME/overview.properties.
* Renamed $STOOL_HOME/wrappers to $STOOL_HOME/backstages.
* Renamed $STOOL_HOME/conf to $STOOL_HOME/run.
* Manual pages for all commands. puc help no longer contains command details, use man stool-&lt;command> instead.
* import: Fixed error message when argument is not a directory.
* Overview: Moved log output into tomcat/logs/overview.log.
* History command: support multiple details argument with ranges.
* History command: properly handle overlapping commands. To implement this i had to fix the log file format: id is unique
  accross file now, because a command started before midnight may finish the next day.
* stool -exception throws an intentional exception now. To test error tool.
